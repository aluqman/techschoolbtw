# TechSchoolBtw Bot

A bot built to ~harass my friends~ make super-ordinary and normal jokes in our Discord chat.

Really, this is more of an excuse for me to mess around with Elixir in a capacity that doesn't involve
Phoenix, and the whole "friends" thing is an excuse. Don't tell them, though!

## Installation

Don't.

Really, don't.

If you'd really like to, for whatever reason, give me a few days to set up the GitHub Action to 
release a version of this every time I tag it as a Docker container. That's a bridge to burn 
at a later date.
